Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] Add FEC rates, S2X params and 64K transmission

dddvb brings a few additional FEC rates (1/4 and 1/3), 64/128/256APSK
modulations and more rolloff factors (DVB-S2X), and 64K transmission mode
(DVB-T2). These rather trivial patches bring them to mainline, and puts
these missing bits into the stv0910's get_frontend() callback (FEC 1/4
and 1/3 are handled throughout the rest of the demod driver already). In
addition (as suggestion from Richard Scobie), the stv0910 driver now
reports it's active delivery system.

Changes from v1 to v2:
- DVB-S2X rolloff factors and reporting
- report of the active delivery system in stv0910:get_frontend()

Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add FEC rates, S2X modulations and 64K transmission

As the DVB API is bumped to 5.11 for the next cycle.

dddvb brings a few additional FEC rates (1/4 and 1/3), 64/128/256APSK
modulations (DVB-S2X) and the 64K transmission mode. These two rather
trivial patches bring them to mainline, and puts these missing bits
into the stv0910's get_frontend() callback (FEC 1/4 and 1/3 are handled
throughout the rest of the demod driver already).

Let's have these enums as a part of DVB core 5.11.

Daniel Scheller (2):
  media: dvb_frontend: add FEC modes, S2X modulations and 64K
    transmission
  media: dvb-frontends/stv0910: report FEC 1/4 and 1/3 in get_frontend()

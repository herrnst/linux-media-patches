Subject: [PATCH 0/5] last-minute misc ddbridge related changed

This small series improves on a few things related to the recently merged
ddbridge driver update:

stv0910:
  * add an explanation for the mutex_lock needs in gate_ctrl() and release
    the lock in case of I2C ctrl errors
  * announce 100Ksyms/s as minimum symbol rate
ddbridge:
  * fix the teardown and deregistration order wrt the i2c_client usage
  * fix most warnings reported by sparse (sparse still reports four
    spinlock/context warnings, that code will be kept as-is - there
    won't be locking problems since the checked pointers won't suddenly
    vanish)
staging/cxd2099:
  * disable buffer mode by default and make that controllable by a module
    parameter (suggested, requested and tested by Jasmin, modparm switch
    done by me)

Please pull these patches in for the 4.14 merge window, together with the
two ([1], [2]) remaining ones on patchwork - thank you very much!

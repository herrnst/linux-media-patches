Subject: [PATCH 0/3] cxd2099: cleanup licensing

Upstream committed a change to the dddvb driver package ([1]) that makes
things clear everything is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2-only.
So, apply the MODULE_LICENSE change to cxd2099 and, as things are sorted
now, apply SPDX license identifiers (and fix two spurious whitespaces).

Split from the series that touches all other Digital Devices drivers
since Jasmin is the maintainer for the cxd2099 driver.

Ralph/Manfred: Although all license related things should be clear by
now, please be so kind and send Acks (or complaints, if any) on these
patches so we can finally get rid of any mismatches in the in-kernel
drivers.

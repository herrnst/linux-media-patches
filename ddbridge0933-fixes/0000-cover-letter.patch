Subject: [PATCH 0/4] ddbridge-0.9.33 fixes and improvements

Four post-ddbridge-0.9.33 patches fixing and improving a few things:

Patch 1 adds protection into the new ddbridge-mci code against an
out-of-bounds array write access as reported by CoverityScan and brought
to attention by Colin Ian King.

Patch 2 adds missing function argument identifiers to ddb_mci_attach() to
silence checkpatch. It still complains about the **fn_set_input which IS
the identifier but doesn't seem to be caught by checkpatch properly.

Patches 3 and 4 enable the higher speed TS mode on stv0910-equipped cards
and thus enables for higher bitrate transponders when the detected card
firmware permits this. This is basically what was removed in the initial
ddbridge-0.9.33 patch series but enhanced to be only enabled when the
FPGA firmware permits this.

Please merge, this should go in alongside the already merged ddbridge
0.9.33 patches. Thanks.

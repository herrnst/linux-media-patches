Subject: [PATCH 0/2] ngene CI TS fixup

Remainder of the ngene updates series, taking care of the TS buffer offset
shift which occurs in conjunction with CICAM hardware during CAM inits.

Changed as requested to get rid of the DEBUG_CI_XFER ifdeffery.

This might aswell be considered a v3 of [1], but as 10 of 12 patches were
merged already, these two patches can be treated separate.

  [media] ngene: move the tsin_exchange() stripcopy block into a
    function
  [media] ngene: compensate for TS buffer offset shifts

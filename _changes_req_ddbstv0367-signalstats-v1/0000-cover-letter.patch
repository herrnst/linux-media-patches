Subject: [PATCH 0/4] STV0367/DDB DVBv5 signal statistics

This series adds DVBv5 statistics support to the new DDB codepath of the
stv0367 demodulator driver.

The changes utilise already existing functionality (in form of register
readouts), but wraps the reads in separate functions so the existing
relative scale reporting can be kept as-is, while adding the v5 stats
in dB scale where appropriate.

From my own testing: Reported values look approx. the same as those
reported by the cxd2841er driver for both -C and -T.

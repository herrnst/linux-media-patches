Subject: [PATCH 0/6] ddbridge: updates from dddvb-0.9.31

Digital Devices bumped their driver package to version 0.9.31, which most
importantly carries all refactorisations which are part of the pending
mainline driver bump (bringing dddvb and the proposed kernel version much
closer to each other), and improves further on that. This series bumps
the mainline driver accordingly.

These patches should go in right after and alongside the ddbridge-0.9.29
v4 bump series (see [1], means: 4.14 window material) so we have an
uptodate driver in mainline when the next major version gets tagged by
Linus.

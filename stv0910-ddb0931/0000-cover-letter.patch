Subject: [PATCH 0/2] stv0910: updates from dddvb 0.9.31

Digital Devices released dddvb-0.9.31 which carries these two fixes for
the stv0910 demodulator driver.

Should go in after the seven stv0910/stv6111 cleanup patches (see [1]),
namely after [2]. They might apply cleanly without them, but they may
also hard-depend and conflict without them (I honestly did not test
this as I applied them ontop of my "carry everything" branch).

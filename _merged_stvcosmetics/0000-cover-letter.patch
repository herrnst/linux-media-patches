Subject: [PATCH 0/2] stv{0910,6111} cosmetics

Two cosmetics for the two new demod/tuner drivers. The stv0910 patch is
a remainder/leftover from the cleanup and cosmetic series, originally
submitted by Colin King. The second one fixes a warning I noticed in
Hans' daily build log.

@Mauro: Together with [1] and [2], everything that cumulated over time
is done now, with the only thing remaining being the IOCTL stuff which
we need to discuss and finalise.

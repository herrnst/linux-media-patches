Subject: [PATCH 0/3] staging/cxd2099: cosmetics, checkpatch fixup

These three small patches make the driver checkpatch-strict clean and
improves a few strings. No functional changes.

Essentially drivers/staging/media/cxd2099/ is now clean, esp.:

$ scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --file drivers/staging/media/cxd2099/cxd2099.c
  total: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 checks, 705 lines checked

$ scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --file drivers/staging/media/cxd2099/cxd2099.h
  total: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 checks, 45 lines checked

The three patches are the outcome of some bigger refactoring WIP.

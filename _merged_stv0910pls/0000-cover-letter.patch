Subject: [PATCH 0/4] stv0910: upstream changes and PLS support

This series basically is meant to fully enable support for physical
layer scrambling which is now supported by the DVB core. Though I
decided to pick up the latest changes to the driver from the dddvb
upstream and bring both drivers in sync. So, along with support for
PLS, these patches apply some cosmetics and cleanups, adds macros to
utilise the field definitions for which the offsets were added
recently, and makes use of them while finally enabling PLS.

Daniel Scheller (4):
  [media] dvb-frontends/stv0910: deduplicate writes in

  [media] dvb-frontends/stv0910: field and register access helpers
  [media] dvb-frontends/stv0910: cleanup init_search_param() and enable
    PLS

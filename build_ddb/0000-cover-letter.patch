Subject: [PATCH 0/3] media_build: fixes wrt the ddbridge code bump

Hans,

these are the patches I've carried around in my media_build fork wrt
ddbridge testing, which obviously should go into upstream, now that
the patches got merged. Things worked pretty well at least up to
(down to) Kernel 3.13 on Ubuntu Trusty, guess some more things need
to be added for even older kernels, but your daily build will probably
tell :) Verified myself against 4.4 (Ubuntu Xenial).

Daniel Scheller (3):
  [media_build] fix pr_fmt patch wrt the ddbridge code bump
  [media_build] patch pci_alloc_irq_vectors() for ddbridge aswell
  [media_build] add compat for __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL

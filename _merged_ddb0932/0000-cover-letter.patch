Subject: [PATCH for 4.15] ddbridge update to 0.9.32

For the 4.15 merge window. These patches update the mainline ddbridge
driver to version 0.9.32, which was released ~3 weeks ago by upstream.

Nothing really fancy in this series, in fact upstream applied many of
the changes that went into the mainline driver, which was released as
0.9.32. A few more changes were applied though, namely the CI DuoFlex/
PCIe Bridge support has been split from -core (like ie. the MaxS8 card
support), upstream named the files with the MaxS8 support code
"-max.[c|h]" (thus the rename), and everything was made checkpatch-
strict clean.

One condition in stv0910.c:read_status() was missing in mainline and is
being added in 7/8.

The series was tested for bisect safety and checked with smatch.

Please pull for 4.15.

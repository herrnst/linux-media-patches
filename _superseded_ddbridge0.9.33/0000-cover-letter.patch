Subject: [PATCH 00/20] dddvb/ddbridge-0.9.33

This series brings all relevant changes from the upstream dddvb-0.9.33
driver package to the in-kernel ddbridge and stv0910, though a few changes
were picked up and merged previously already.

Summary of changes:
* stv0910: initialisation fixes and fixed CNR reporting (uvalue vs.
  svalue)
* ddbridge: general code move, cleanups and fixups
* ddbridge: fixes and improvements to the IRQ setup and handling, and
  MSI-X support
* ddbridge: configurable DMA buffers (via modparam)
* ddbridge: dummy tuner option, useful for debugging and stress testing
  purposes
* ddbridge: support for the new MCI card types, and namely the new MaxSX8
  cards

Patches were build-tested in their order and are bisect safe. Besides the
modparam move, everything is picked up from dddvb-0.9.33.

The series adds the new ddbridge-mci.[c|h] files. Here, SPDX headers were
already put in place, but until things have been fully sorted out, the
original GPL boiler plate is kept in place for now.

Please pick up and merge.
